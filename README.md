# Interactive Mazzawi Family Tree


a web project (webpage) that merges between the old 1949 drawing of the Mazzawi family tree (in arabic) - seen below , with the newer [2009 english language tree](./res/mazzawi_english)

It is basically an image map of the tree that utilizes the jquery package of "maphilight" to highlight and open an image of the subtree of the leaf / branch clicked on the original drawing.  The image shown inside a "modal" div is the subtree from the English language 2009 tree that corresponds to the clicked leaf / branch (as its root).

project contains 155 images from the 2009 english language tree (that were print-screened and re-edited extensively) ; each image corresponds to either a leaf or a branch (or the tree's trunk or under it which contains info about Mazzawi Family's history and origin).


you can view the project at https://iskmz.com/MazzawiFamily/mz_tree/

or download a copy for offline view from releases or from the download icon at https://iskmz.com/

the downloaded project contains an additional .exe which basically runs a batch which gives options to open in browser's KIOSK / fullscreen mode (supports chrome, firefox or msedge)

----------

all rights for the drawing and the english language tree belong to their respective creators

but since these important creations were lost after the closing of [mazzawi.net](http://mazzawi.net/) website and after looking for them online, I was able to recover them from the wayback machine mostly and from and old hdd backup drive which the drawing was stored on years ago.

----------


***
the main idea & goal behind this project is to make an easy to navigate tree for the benefit of the Mazzawi Family members all over the world and to be a platform that the future (& current) generations could add to, change & correct information regarding their ancestry and add new family members as the years go by.

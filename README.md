# Interactive Mazzawi Family Tree


a web project (webpage) that merges between the old [1949 drawing](./res/mazzawi-family-tree-1949.png) of the Mazzawi family tree (in arabic) , with the newer [2009 english language tree](./res/mazzawi_english)

It is basically an image map of the tree that utilizes the jquery package of [maphilight](https://github.com/kemayo/maphilight) to highlight and open an image of the subtree of the leaf / branch clicked on.  The image shown inside a "modal" div is the subtree from the English language 2009 tree that corresponds to the clicked leaf / branch (as its root).

project contains 155 images from the 2009 english language tree - that were print-screened and re-edited extensively. Each image corresponds to either a leaf or a branch (or the tree's trunk or under it which contains info about Mazzawi Family's history and origin).


you can view the project at https://iskmz.com/MazzawiFamily/mz_tree/

or download a copy for offline view from releases or from the download icon at https://iskmz.com/

the downloaded project contains an additional .exe which basically runs a batch which gives options to open in browser's KIOSK / fullscreen mode (supports chrome, firefox or msedge)

----------

all rights for the drawing and the english language tree belong to their respective creators

but since these important creations were lost after the closing of [mazzawi.net](http://mazzawi.net/) website and after looking for them online, I was able to recover them from the wayback machine mostly , and from an old hdd backup drive which the drawing was stored on years ago.

# Interactive Mazzawi Family Tree


a webpage that merges between the old [1949 drawing](./res/mazzawi-family-tree-1949.png) of the Mazzawi family tree (in arabic) , with the newer [2009 english language tree](./res/mazzawi_english)

It is basically an image map of the tree that utilizes the jquery package of [maphilight](https://github.com/kemayo/maphilight) to highlight selected map areas, which when clicked upon an image of the subtree of the leaf/branch as its root opens inside a "modal" div.  The subtree is from the English language 2009 tree.

project contains 155 images from the 2009 english language tree - that were print-screened and re-edited extensively.

map areas' coordinates were done using the help of https://www.image-map.net/

view the project at https://iskmz.com/MazzawiFamily/mz_tree/  or download an offline copy from [releases](https://github.com/iskmz/InteractiveMazzawiFamilyTree/releases)

downloaded project contains an additional .exe which basically runs a batch which gives options to open in browser's KIOSK / fullscreen mode

at the moment, it is viewed best at ***100% zoom on a desktop PC !***

----------

all rights for the drawing and the english language tree belong to their respective creators

they were recovered from the apparently closed [mazzawi.net](http://mazzawi.net/) website using the wayback machine, and from an old hdd backup drive which the drawing was stored on years ago.

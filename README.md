# Interactive Mazzawi Family Tree


a web project (webpage) that merges between an old 1949 drawing of the Mazzawi family tree (in arabic) with the newer 2009 english language tree

It is basically an image map of the tree that utilizes the jquery package of "maphilight" to highlight and open an image of the subtree of the leaf / branch clicked on the original drawing.  The image shown inside a "modal" div is the subtree from the English language 2009 tree that corresponds to the clicked leaf / branch (as its root).

project contains 155 images from the 2009 english language tree (that were print-screened and re-edited extensively) ; each image corresponds to either a leaf or a branch (or the tree's trunk or under it which contains info about Mazzawi Family's history and origin).


everything is completely safe

no trojans , no viruses, nothing !

Windows system might detect:  Trojan:Script/Wacatac.H!ml
for the "mazzawi_english_v3_table-data.js"   file

but it just contains the family members data to build the html-table from

so I provided an additional "mazzawi_english_v3_table-data.js.txt" file
which is an exact copy, but with txt extension , so simply remove the txt extension

OR you can disable the antivirus check ...
